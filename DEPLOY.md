# Deploying kigumi.app

The site is an Astro 5 static build. Hosting target: **Cloudflare Pages**,
git-connected, auto-deploy on push to `main`. Writing a markdown file in
`src/content/essays/` and pushing is the entire publish workflow.

## Build settings (Cloudflare Pages dashboard)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework preset | Astro |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Root directory | *(blank — project is the repo root)* |
| Environment variable | `NODE_VERSION` = `20` |

Cloudflare's build image does **not** provide Node 25. `NODE_VERSION=20`
(or `22`) is required or the build fails. `.nvmrc` pins it locally.

## One-time setup + DNS cutover (must be done in a browser — Claude Code cannot)

Zero-downtime: GitHub Pages keeps serving `kigumi.app` until step 7. The
legacy `index.html` / `how-it-works.html` / `style.css` / `CNAME` stay in the
repo until the preview is validated, so the old site never breaks.

```
PRE-CUTOVER (safe; live site unaffected)
[ ] 1. Cloudflare → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git
[ ] 2. Authorize GitHub, select repo Le-Steph/merlion, branch main
[ ] 3. Build settings: preset Astro · cmd `npm run build` · output `dist`
       · root blank · env NODE_VERSION=20
[ ] 4. Save & Deploy. Wait for the first build to go green.
[ ] 5. Open the *.pages.dev preview URL. Verify:
       /, /how-it-works, /writing, /rss.xml, /sitemap-index.xml,
       the waiting-list form submit (network call to loops.so),
       favicons, OG card (https://<preview>/og-default.png).
       Drafts are hidden in the build — /writing is empty until an
       essay's `draft:` is set to false. That is expected.

DNS CUTOVER (flips the domain — only after preview is good)
[ ] 6. Pages project → Custom domains → add  kigumi.app  (and  www  if used)
[ ] 7. DNS:
       - If kigumi.app DNS is already on Cloudflare: confirm the
         auto-created record resolves.
       - If DNS is elsewhere / on GitHub Pages: remove the GitHub Pages
         A records (185.199.108-111.153) and any apex/www CNAME, then
         add the record Cloudflare instructs (CNAME → <project>.pages.dev,
         or move the zone to Cloudflare nameservers).
[ ] 8. GitHub repo → Settings → Pages → Source = None; remove the custom
       domain there so GitHub stops serving kigumi.app.
[ ] 9. Verify https://kigumi.app loads the Astro site with valid TLS
       (Cloudflare issues the cert automatically).
[ ] 10. Confirm auto-deploy: push any commit to main → Pages rebuilds.

POST-CUTOVER (in-repo, do as the final commit once 1-10 pass)
[ ] 11. Delete the legacy files: index.html, how-it-works.html,
        style.css, CNAME. They are preserved in git history and on
        the pre-cutover commits as the rollback path.
```

## Rollback

Until step 7, `kigumi.app` resolves to GitHub Pages serving the original
static site. If the Cloudflare build or preview is wrong, do **not** flip
DNS — iterate on the `.pages.dev` URL. If DNS was already flipped and a
regression appears: re-point DNS to the GitHub Pages A records and
re-enable GitHub Pages Source. The legacy HTML remains in git history;
never force-push over it.

## Publishing an essay (the steady-state workflow)

1. Add `src/content/essays/<slug>.md` with frontmatter
   (`title`, `description`, `pubDate`, `pillar`, `draft`).
2. While drafting keep `draft: true` — visible in `npm run dev`
   (localhost:4321), hidden in the production build.
3. When ready, set `draft: false`, commit, push to `main`.
4. Cloudflare Pages rebuilds and the post is live, in `/rss.xml`,
   and in `/sitemap-index.xml`.

Local commands: `npm run dev` · `npm run build` · `npm run preview`
· `npm run check`. Regenerate the OG card after editing
`public/og-default.svg`: `node scripts/build-og.mjs`.
